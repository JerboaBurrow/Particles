### Not all contributions have to be code

Bug reports, feature ideas, and refactoring suggestions are very welcome in the issues tab. Feel free to submit an issue for these.

### General (best case) workflow for code contributions

- Create an issue with proposed changes, identifying the problems and fixes
  - This way we know who is doing what, we minimise wasted time
- Discuss approaches in the issue
- Fork, and implement changes on a new branch in your fork
  - Android studio is recommended for working on your changes
- Test the code compiles
- Test on an android device (if you do not have one, the emulator in Android studio)
- PR when the code compiles and runs on a device/emulator
- Automated tests (i.e. the code compiles) must pass
- Your code will be tested (manually) on some physical devices to catch any issues
    - Currently including: Nexus 5, Google Pixel, Sony Xperia I (Original), and maybe a Samsung S9 if it feels up to it 
    - This may take some time to do, please be patient, it really does save time in the long run though
- If all is well your PR will be merged
- Please indicate what name (can be some social handle, including a link as well) to appear in credits
- Your code will appear in a subsequent release, subject to passing the Google Play Console Pre-launch report
- If issues arise in the Pre-launch report, your collaboration will be greatly appreciated.
